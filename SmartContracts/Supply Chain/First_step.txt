1. All we need to set is a hardhat dev setup...
2. Open the terminal and type "npm init -y" -> This will create a package.json file. There you can add your email or something to author section..if you wish to..
3. Next type the command "npm install --save-dev hardhat" -> This will create all the required dependencies and tools used for your smart contracts hardhat or whatever shit you wanna do...This will create nodemodules folder and one more json file
4. Next type the command "npx hardhat" -> This gonna start setting your project dependencies up
5. After that their will be a question in the terminal "What do you want to do?"..Answer according to the required project..tho "Create a JavaScript project" gonna be our preferable answer.
6. Then press enter and enter...
7. Now the hardhat will tell you to run this command in order to install the remaining dependencies.. " npm install --save-dev "hardhat@^2.13.0" "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox@^2.0.0" "..Well run it.
8. We all set..just one last step. Most of the times we gonna use openzepplin contracts library to make our work easy...Hence run "npm install @openzeppelin/contracts"
